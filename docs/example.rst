Example project
===============

Project tree contains two example projects in `test/example_bootstrap` and `test/example_thirdparty` folders,
it is fully deployed and ready to use forum applications. Only one distinction between this projects:
example_bootstrap includes Twitter bootstrap's less files while example_thirdparty leave this to thirdparty apps -
pinax-theme-bootstrap, django-forms-bootstrap and pinax-theme-bootstrap-account. We recommend to use thirdparty apps to start with.
If you starting from scratch it's probably the best way to begin.
